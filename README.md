  id: 1,
  name: 'Admin User',
  email: 'admin@example.com',
  roles: ['administrator']
});

// Teacher
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({
  id: 2,
  name: 'John Teacher',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  roles: ['teacher']
});

// Mentor
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({
  id: 4,
  name: 'Bob Mentor',
  email: 'bob@example.com',
  roles: ['mentor']
});

// Student
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({
  id: 5,
  name: 'Alice Student',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  roles: ['student']
});
```
